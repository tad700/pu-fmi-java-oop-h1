# BookKeeper

I have developed a console application in Java to showcase my understanding of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles. The program is a multiclass library that allows users to create and manage their own library.

Upon launching the program, users are prompted to create their library by entering relevant information such as name, address, and other parameters. Once created, the user is presented with a user-friendly menu from which they can add, remove, or update books in their library.

Books can be added to the library by providing details such as the title, genre, author, publisher, and ISBN, which serves as the unique identifier for each book. The program also allows users to update book information by selecting the relevant ISBN and choosing which aspect of the book they wish to update.
The application is designed to be user-friendly and ensures the security of the user's data through encapsulation, thereby enhancing the overall user experience.
